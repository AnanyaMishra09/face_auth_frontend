Configure Environment Variables

This project uses an environment variable to know the address of the backend API. For local development, the code includes a fallback to http://127.0.0.1:5001.

For production, you will set this variable on your deployment platform (see Deployment section).

Run the Development Server

npm run dev

The application will now be running at http://localhost:5173.

üîë Configuration
The application connects to the backend API using an environment variable.

VITE_API_URL: The full URL of your deployed backend server (e.g., https://your-api.onrender.com).

When running locally, you do not need to set this, as the code will automatically connect to your local backend server.
